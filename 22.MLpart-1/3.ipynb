    "   df = pd.DataFrame({'A': [1, 2, None, 4], 'B': [5, None, None, 8]})\n",
    "   df_cleaned = df.dropna()  # Drop rows with missing values\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Mean/Median/Mode imputation**\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   df['A'].fillna(df['A'].mean(), inplace=True)  # Replace NaN with mean\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Forward/Backward Fill**\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   df.fillna(method='ffill', inplace=True)  # Forward fill missing data\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Imputation using algorithms (e.g., KNN Imputer)**\n",
    "   ```python\n",

    "\n",
    "If not handled, machine learning models tend to become biased toward the majority class, resulting in:\n",
