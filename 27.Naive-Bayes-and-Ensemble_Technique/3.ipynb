    "\n",
    "### Q1: What is an ensemble technique in machine learning?\n",
    "\n",
    "An **ensemble technique** in machine learning combines the predictions from multiple models (classifiers or regressors) to improve overall performance. It aims to produce more accurate predictions by compensating for the weaknesses of individual models.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q2: Why are ensemble techniques used in machine learning?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ensemble techniques are used to:\n",
    "- Improve the accuracy of models by combining their strengths.\n",
    "- Reduce overfitting by averaging or combining multiple models.\n",
    "- Increase robustness to noise or variability in the data.\n",
    "- Handle both variance (by reducing overfitting) and bias (by combining weak learners).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q3: What is bagging?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bagging** (Bootstrap Aggregating) is an ensemble technique where:\n",
    "- Multiple subsets of data are created through random sampling with replacement.\n",
    "- A separate model is trained on each subset.\n",
    "- The final prediction is made by averaging (for regression) or voting (for classification) over all models' predictions.\n",
    "  \n",
    "It reduces variance and helps prevent overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q4: What is boosting?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Boosting** is an ensemble technique that builds models sequentially:\n",
    "- Each subsequent model is trained to correct the errors made by the previous models.\n",
    "- The models are weighted based on their performance.\n",
    "- The final prediction is a weighted sum or vote of all models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Boosting focuses on improving the performance by correcting model weaknesses.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q5: What are the benefits of using ensemble techniques?\n",
    "\n",
    "Benefits of ensemble techniques include:\n",
    "- Improved predictive accuracy.\n",
    "- Increased robustness to overfitting or noise.\n",
    "- Reduction of variance and bias in the model.\n",
    "- Better generalization to unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q6: Are ensemble techniques always better than individual models?\n",
    "\n",
    "No, ensemble techniques are not always better than individual models. In cases where:\n",
    "- The individual models are already strong and accurate.\n",
    "- Ensemble models may introduce additional complexity without substantial improvements.\n",
    "- There may be computational overhead due to training multiple models.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q7: How is the confidence interval calculated using bootstrap?\n",
    "\n",
    "To calculate a confidence interval using bootstrap:\n",
    "1. Generate multiple bootstrap samples from the original dataset.\n",
    "2. Calculate the statistic (e.g., mean) for each sample.\n",
    "3. Use the distribution of these statistics to compute the confidence interval (e.g., the 95th percentile interval).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q8: How does bootstrap work and what are the steps involved in bootstrap?\n",
    "\n",
    "Bootstrap involves:\n",
    "1. Randomly sampling the data with replacement to create multiple \"bootstrap samples.\"\n",
    "2. Calculating the statistic of interest (e.g., mean) for each sample.\n",
    "3. Repeating this process many times to build a distribution of the statistic.\n",
    "4. Using the distribution to estimate the confidence interval for the statistic.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q9: Use bootstrap to estimate the 95% confidence interval for the mean height of a population of trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given:\n",
    "- Mean height = 15 meters\n",
    "- Standard deviation = 2 meters\n",
    "- Sample size = 50\n",
    "\n",
    "Using bootstrap:\n",
    "1. Resample the data with replacement to generate multiple datasets.\n",
    "2. Compute the mean for each resample.\n",
    "3. Construct the 95% confidence interval by taking the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles of the bootstrap sample means.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: Implement this in a Jupyter notebook and share your results on GitHub."
