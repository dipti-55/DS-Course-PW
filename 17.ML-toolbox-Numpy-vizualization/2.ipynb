    "## Q1: What is Matplotlib? Why is it used? Name five plots that can be plotted using the Pyplot module of Matplotlib.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Matplotlib** is a comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python. It is widely used for data visualization because it offers a variety of charts and plots that help represent data effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is used to:\n",
    "- Create high-quality graphs and plots.\n",
    "- Visualize data distributions and relationships between data.\n",
    "- Produce visual output for analysis in various scientific, statistical, and engineering fields.\n",
    "\n",
    "Five plots that can be created using the Pyplot module of Matplotlib are:\n",
    "1. **Line plot**\n",
    "2. **Scatter plot**\n",
    "3. **Bar plot**\n",
    "4. **Histogram**\n",
    "5. **Box plot**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Q2: What is a scatter plot? Use the following code to generate data for x and y. Using this generated data, plot a scatter plot.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **scatter plot** is a type of plot used to visualize the relationship between two variables. Each point on the plot represents a data point, with its position determined by its values for the two variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Code to generate data and plot a scatter plot:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n",
    "\n",
    "np.random.seed(3)\n",
    "\n",
    "x = 3 + np.random.normal(0, 2, 50)\n",
    "y = 3 + np.random.normal(0, 2, len(x))\n",
    "\n",
    "plt.scatter(x, y)\n",
    "plt.title(\"Scatter Plot of Generated Data\")\n",
    "plt.xlabel(\"X-axis\")\n",
    "plt.ylabel(\"Y-axis\")\n",
    "plt.show()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Q3: Why is the `subplot()` function used? Draw four line plots using the `subplot()` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `subplot()` function is used to create multiple plots in the same figure. It allows you to arrange multiple subplots (axes) in a grid layout.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Code to draw four line plots using `subplot()`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n",
    "\n",
    "x = np.array([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5])\n",
    "\n",
    "y1 = np.array([0, 100, 200, 300, 400, 500])\n",
    "y2 = np.array([50, 20, 40, 20, 60, 70])\n",
    "y3 = np.array([10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60])\n",
    "y4 = np.array([200, 350, 250, 550, 450, 150])\n",
    "\n",
    "plt.subplot(2, 2, 1)\n",
    "plt.plot(x, y1)\n",
    "plt.title(\"Line 1\")\n",
    "\n",
    "plt.subplot(2, 2, 2)\n",
    "plt.plot(x, y2)\n",
    "plt.title(\"Line 2\")\n",

    "plt.title(\"Line 3\")\n",

    "## Q4: What is a bar plot? Why is it used? Using the following data, plot a bar plot and a horizontal bar plot.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **bar plot** displays categorical data with rectangular bars. The height or length of each bar is proportional to the value it represents. It is commonly used to compare quantities across different categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Code to create a bar plot and a horizontal bar plot:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",

    "plt.bar(company, profit)\n",
    "plt.title(\"Company Profits\")\n",
    "plt.xlabel(\"Company\")\n",
    "plt.ylabel(\"Profit\")\n",

    "# Horizontal bar plot\n",
    "plt.barh(company, profit)\n",
    "plt.title(\"Company Profits (Horizontal)\")\n",

    "## Q5: What is a box plot? Why is it used? Using the following data, plot a box plot.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **box plot** (or **box-and-whisker plot**) is a standardized way of displaying the distribution of data based on five summary statistics: minimum, first quartile (Q1), median, third quartile (Q3), and maximum. It is used to:\n",
    "- Visualize the distribution of data.\n",
    "- Identify outliers.\n",
    "- Compare distributions between different datasets.\n",
