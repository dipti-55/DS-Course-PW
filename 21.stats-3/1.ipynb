    "The margin of error in a confidence interval represents the range within which we expect the true population parameter to fall, given the sample data.

    "Since the absolute value of the calculated t-value (5.49) is greater than the critical t-value (1.699), we reject the null hypothesis. This indicates that there is a significant effect of caffeine on reaction time at the 90% confidence level.\n",

    "Based on the t-test, we conclude that caffeine significantly affects reaction time, with the observed average reaction time being significantly different from the expected average without caffeine at the 90% confidence level."
