    "### Q1. What is the difference between Ordinal Encoding and Label Encoding? Provide an example of when you might choose one over the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Ordinal Encoding** is used when the categorical data has a natural order or ranking among its categories. In ordinal encoding, each category is assigned a unique integer that reflects this order.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Label Encoding** is used when the categorical data does not have a specific order or ranking among its categories. Each category is assigned a unique integer, but the integers do not imply any relationship between the categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Example:*\n",
    "- **Ordinal Encoding:** For a feature like `Size` (Small, Medium, Large), you would use ordinal encoding because there is a natural order.\n",
    "  - Small → 1\n",
    "  - Medium → 2\n",
    "  - Large → 3\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Label Encoding:** For a feature like `Color` (Red, Blue, Green), you would use label encoding because the colors have no natural order.\n",
    "  - Red → 0\n",
    "  - Blue → 1\n",
    "  - Green → 2\n",

    "### Q2. Explain how Target Guided Ordinal Encoding works and provide an example of when you might use it in a machine learning project.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Target Guided Ordinal Encoding** involves ordering the categories of a categorical variable based on the mean of the target variable. This encoding technique is useful when there is a significant relationship between the categorical variable and the target variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Example:*\n",
    "In a dataset predicting house prices, if you have a feature like `Neighborhood` with categories such as A, B, and C, you can compute the mean house price for each neighborhood and then encode the neighborhoods based on these means.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If Neighborhood A has the highest mean house price, it would be encoded with the highest value.\n",

    "### Q3. Define covariance and explain why it is important in statistical analysis. How is covariance calculated?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Covariance** measures the degree to which two variables change together. It is a statistical indicator of the relationship between two variables, indicating whether they tend to increase or decrease together. \n",
    "\n",
    "Covariance is important in statistical analysis as it helps in understanding the direction of the relationship between variables, which is essential in many data analysis tasks, such as feature selection and multivariate analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Calculation:*\n",
    "\n",
    "Covariance between two variables \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) is calculated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "\\text{Cov}(X, Y) = \\frac{1}{n-1} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (X_i - \\bar{X})(Y_i - \\bar{Y})\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- \\(X_i\\) and \\(Y_i\\) are the individual sample points.\n",
    "- \\(\\bar{X}\\) and \\(\\bar{Y}\\) are the means of the variables \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\).\n",
    "- \\(n\\) is the number of data points.\n",

    "**Answer:**\n",

You are working on a machine learning project with a dataset containing several categorical variables, including \"Gender\" (Male/Female), \"Education Level\" (High School/Bachelor's/Master's/PhD), and \"Employment Status\" (Unemployed/Part-Time/Full-Time). Which encoding method would you use for each variable, and why?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Gender (Binary Categorical Variable):**\n",
    "  - Use **Label Encoding** or **Binary Encoding** because there are only two categories.\n",
